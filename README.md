This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Kotlin when using the `map` function with lists. The `map` function in Kotlin, unlike some other languages, creates a *new* list with the transformed elements instead of modifying the original list in-place. This can lead to unexpected behavior if developers assume it modifies the original list.  The solution showcases how to use `mapTo` to achieve in-place modification.
